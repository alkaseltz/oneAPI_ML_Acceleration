# oneAPI_ML_Acceleration

Abstract:

With the maturation of the machine learning industry, new technologies emerge that expand the access to said industry. As such, it is pertinent to engage in research regarding these technologies. As students of Cal Poly, in collaboration with Dr. Maria Pantoja, we will attempt to delve into Intel’s oneAPI and openVINO deep-learning library and compare its performance to other deep-learning libraries such as Tensorflow/Pytorch. Moreover, we will analyze the hardware architecture’s effect on the performances of these machine learning libraries, as we will be utilizing both Intel and NVIDIA GPUs. To narrow the scope of the project, we will be using a simple image classification model as a testbench to perform a comparative analysis of an Intel GPU using the openVINO ML library against the Tensorflow/Pytorch ML library on an NVIDIA GPU. The benchmarks will be performed on Intel’s Guadi 2 and Nvidia’s H100 architectures respectively, facilitated by the Intel and Google clouds. Additionally, we would like to leverage oneAPI to explore the performance benefits of heterogeneous computing. We can accomplish this by testing and analyzing a more complex model to identify areas that are suitable for offloaded acceleration. Through this research, we hope to aid in the development of course content concerning cloud GPU compute and oneAPI for Cal Poly’s CPE-419 Applied Parallel Computing course.
